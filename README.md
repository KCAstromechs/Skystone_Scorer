# Usage

You can use this scorer in two ways:
1) **Score calculator** for after-the-fact scoring or strategic planning tool.
   * Use the `Auto` and `TeleOp` buttons to switch between the block placement modes.  The count values preceeded by a plus sign indicate they get the autonomous bonus scores.
   * All parking, platform moving, and other tasks can be toggled freely

2) **Live match scorer** with built in timer
   * Click the ![Play](play_circle_outline.svg) button to start the match.
   * Scoring elements are only available to click at the appropriate times.  (E.g. you can't score endgame parking until the last 30 seconds).  Projected final score is displayed at all times.
   * After the match completes all scoring elements can be adjusted to obtain final score.

# TODO:
* More tweaking of the layout to better fit differerent devices/orientations.
* Ability to signify "robot touching" or "not locked" to invalidate skyscraper
* Returned stone counters


## Future ideas
* Possibly a single-side mode?
* Possibility of recording stone orientation when stacking?
* Sounds for start/end when using the timer?
* A standard match report?
